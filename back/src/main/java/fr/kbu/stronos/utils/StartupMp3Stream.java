/**
 * Used with some restricted computers (ex : raspberry), the first batch of mp3 encoding are taking
 * to much time to unsure a continuous stream.
 *
 * This is probably due to a lot of first object instantiation. I don't know if raspberry use
 * Hotspot, but the JVM could also optimize the run by itself after a few loops of doing the same
 * thing. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization)
 *
 * 1 buffer = 16384 samples | 1 sec = 44100 samples | 1 sec = 44100 / 16384 = 2.69 buffers
 *
 * The goal of this specialized stream is to close itself after a warmup time (13 loops approx 4.82
 * sec)
